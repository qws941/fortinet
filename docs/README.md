## 🔄 GitOps CI/CD Pipeline

The platform uses a modern GitOps workflow:

```
Code Change → GitHub Actions → Harbor Registry → Helm Charts → ArgoCD → Kubernetes
```

**Current Deployment Status:**
- **Registry**: registry.jclee.me
- **Charts**: charts.jclee.me  
- **ArgoCD**: argo.jclee.me
- **Production**: http://192.168.50.110:30777
